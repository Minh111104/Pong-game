# Pong-game üèì

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library. Two players control paddles to keep the ball in play. The game tracks the score, updates the speed of the ball, and includes collision detection with the paddles and walls.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Controls for both players to move paddles up and down.
- **Dynamic Ball Movement**: The ball bounces off walls and paddles and increases speed with each paddle hit.
- **Score Tracking**: A scoreboard displays the score for each player.
- **Game Over Detection**: The ball resets when missed by a paddle, and the score updates accordingly.

## Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pong_game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed and has Turtle graphics support.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script:
    ```bash
    python main.py

2. Use the following controls for paddle movement:
   - **Right Paddle**: Press the `Up` arrow to move up, `Down` arrow to move down.
   - **Left Paddle**: Press `W` to move up and `S` to move down.
